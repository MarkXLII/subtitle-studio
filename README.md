# subtitle-studio
Subtitle Studio creates, converts, uploads and download subtitles.

The current source is a 4 year old source of [Subtitle Studio 3.1](http://projects.swapnilbhoite.in/subtitlestudio/), hence need **a lot of** refactoring.
The project structure is in compliance with NetBeans IDE.
Main libraries used:
- vlcj 1.1.5.1 (for video playback)
- dropbox sdk 1.3 (for uploads and downloads)
